# DraftKings-Soccer [Deprecated]
 Web Scraper for Draftkings Soccer Data Aggregation

<strong>Fbref-scraper</strong> takes a team, league, or all leagues (of currently supported leagues) as input and outputs all data stored on fbref.com for each player - and each statistic for each match of the player's current season - in an Excel file.

I created this scraper to get quick access to data to inform my daily fantasy picks in DraftKings.

Currently, the English Premier League, the Spanish La Liga, the Italian Serie A, and the English Championship are all supported.

However, Fbref.com has recently updated its website, so this program requires modification before it will be fully useable again. Expect an update before the Premier League returns in mid-September 2020.

<strong>Lineup.py</strong> and the .txt file are an attempt to optimize a Draftkings lineup using a greedy knapsack algorithm. It not operational. I'm open to collaboration if you have a possible solution to this problem (maximizing expected points given associated cost for each player and a maximum total possible cost).
